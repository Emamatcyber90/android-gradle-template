## Build Variants settings

Change the build variants test artifact type to unit tests.
Since we can use a test module for instrumentation tests we don't need to switch between them anymore.

## Android Studio - Espresso

When you are on Test Artifact Unit Tests then you don't get the possibility to start instrumented tests.
