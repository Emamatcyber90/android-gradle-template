# Android tests on Firebase TestLab

CircleCi has no good emulator support yet because only arm is available which is unstable and slow.
Just a few steps for free stable emulators with Firebase TestLab.

## Prerequisites

* Have a google account.
* Create a project https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/
* Enable the **Google Cloud Testing API** and the **Cloud Tool Results API** by typing their names into the search box at the top of the console and clicking Enable API. https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library
* Create a service account by following Steps 1-3 of [Googleâ€™s instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorizing_with_a_service_account). Remember to download the JSON-formatted key file.

## CircleCi project environment variables

#### GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID

You can find the correct ID in your TestLab project settings https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/YOUR-PROJECT/settings/general/
It's the same name as the project when it not existed already before.

#### GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY

The content of the previous downloaded JSON file.

#### GOOGLE_COMPUTE_ZONE

Use this identifiers https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/

#### GOOGLE_TESTLAB_RESULTS

It's tricky. First run a manuel test by uploading your apk to Firebase TestLab.
Equal whether tests are success or not, open the test results "VIEW SOURCE FILES" and use the `test-lab-*` part from the URL.
