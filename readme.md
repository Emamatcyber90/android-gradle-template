# Android - Rapid Test Driven Development

Mainly this template shows how tools which can be used to generate all the boilerplate code and provides examples how to test different aspects of an android application.
Also show shows a clean architecture example with MVP and package by feature.

**Wishes, improvements and discussions about the stuff here are welcome.**

* Generate view access and listener by [Android Annotations](docs/src/main/resources/tools/androidannotations.md)
* Generate REST Client by [Android Annotations](docs/src/main/resources/tools/androidannotations.md)
* Generate Json Mapping by [JsonSchema 2 Pojo](docs/src/main/resources/tools/jsonschema2pojo.md)
* Generate Database handling by [ContentProvider Generator](docs/src/main/resources/tools/android_contentprovider_generator.md)
* Simplify Background and UiThread actions with [Android Annotations](docs/src/main/resources/tools/androidannotations.md)
* Testing your app on Device/Emulator with [Espresso](docs/src/main/resources/tools/espresso.md)
* Testing your app at JVM with [Robolectric](docs/src/main/resources/tools/robolectric.md) or simple Unit Tests

For more documentation see [Project Documentations](docs/src/main/resources/index.md)

## Latest tested basic tool versions

* Android Studio 1.3.2
* Gradle Build Tools 1.3.0
* Gradle 2.6
* Android v22

## Getting Started

Start an emulator or connect with device, on commandline navigate into the project root and execute from there `tools/src/main/resources/test-all-with-coverage.sh` to check that all works. Import the project with Android Studio and start developing.
