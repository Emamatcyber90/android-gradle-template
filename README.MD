## Notes

### Minimum version

Current we use **Android Version 21** which is enough for 85% of the users and gives some nice defaults.
Current nothing should really block you to select a lower minimum version.

--todo-- advantages of minimum versions

topic / api | ?? | 21 | 23
---|---|---|---
material design ||default style|default style

### Change package and application name

### Dependency Injection

Most times its enough to use **AndroidAnnotation** instead of more advantage tools like Dagger.
This library points in simplicity and developing speed.

### Unhandled topics

* Compile Warning: App is not indexable by Google Search; ...
* Compile Warning: On SDK version 23 and up, ... adding \`android:fullBackupContent\`
